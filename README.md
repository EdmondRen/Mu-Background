# Background study

**Steps**:

1. Estimate resources needed and parameters for Pythia
    a. Generate 20,000 muons (with muon gun) from IP, with 8,12,20,30,40 GeV Pt
    b. Log down the time, storage, efficiency (muons that leave hits) at each Pt
    c. Plot the nhits distribution vs eta/phi. 
2. Veto strategy
    a. Track projection
    b. Track intersection with virtual IP track
    c. (modular only) Projection into gap
